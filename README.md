Full Stack Development Lab Journal  
Seat No: 40255  
Course: BCA  
Subject: Full Stack Development  
Labs Completed: 12  

Introduction  
This journal includes all the practical work I did during my Full Stack Development subject. I learned how to build websites from backend to frontend using tools like Node.js, Express, Sequelize, and React. Each lab helped me understand a new concept and how it fits into real-world web development.
 

Lab 1: Starting with Node.js and Express  
- Installed Node.js and created a basic project using npm  
- Made a simple Express server that sends a text response  
Learned: How servers work and how to handle routes  

Lab 2: Using Lodash  
- Installed Lodash and used functions like chunk and sortBy  
Learned: How external libraries make coding easier  

Lab 3: Error Handling and Events  
- Tried custom error messages and async callbacks  
- Used EventEmitter to trigger events  
Learned: How Node.js handles errors and events  

Lab 4: Reminder App  
- Made a small app to set reminders using setTimeout  
- Used events to show notifications  
Learned: How timers and events can be used in apps  

Lab 5: Routing and Streaming  
- Created multiple routes in Express  
- Used file streams and pipe to send data  
Learned: How to handle large files without loading everything in memory  

Lab 6: Cron Jobs  
- Installed node-cron and scheduled tasks  
- Logged messages to console and files  
Learned: How to automate tasks at fixed times  

Lab 7: Setting Up Sequelize  
- Installed Sequelize and connected it to a database  
- Synced models with the database  
Learned: Basics of ORM and database setup  

Lab 8: User Model and CRUD  
- Created a user model with fields like name and email  
- Performed Create, Read, Update, Delete operations  
Learned: How to manage data using Sequelize  

Lab 9: Model Relationships  
- Made One-to-One, One-to-Many, and Many-to-Many relationships  
- Used Sequelize methods like hasMany and belongsToMany  
Learned: How to link tables in a database  

Lab 10: React Setup  
- Installed React using npx create-react-app  
- Explored folder structure and displayed sample text  
Learned: How to start a React project and render UI  

Lab 11: Components and Routing  
- Created Home, About, and Contact components  
- Used react-router-dom for navigation  
Learned: How to build multi-page apps with React  

Lab 12: Connecting Frontend and Backend  
- Used fetch and axios to get data from Express backend  
- Displayed dynamic data in React  
Learned: How frontend and backend talk to each other  

Conclusion  
This journal shows a step-by-step journey through full stack development. It starts with backend basics, moves into database handling, and finishes with frontend creation and integration. 
Each lab builds practical skills needed to develop complete web applications.
